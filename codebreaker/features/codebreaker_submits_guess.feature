Feature: code-breaker submits guess

  The code-breaker submits a guess of four numbers.  The game marks the guess with + and - signs.

  For each number in the guess that matches the number and position of a number in the secret code, the mark includes one + sign. 
  For each number in the guess that matches the number but not the position of a number in the secret code, the mark includes one - sign.

  Scenario: All exact matches
    Given the secret code is '1234'
    When  I guess '1234'
    Then  the mark should be '++++'

  Scenario: 2 exact matches and 2 number matches
    Given the secret code is '1234'
    When  I guess '1243'
    Then  the mark should be '++--'

  Scenario: 1 exact matches and 3 number matches
    Given the secret code is '1234'
    When  I guess '1342'
    Then  the mark should be '+---'

  Scenario: 4 number matches
    Given the secret code is '1234'
    When  I guess '4321'
    Then  the mark should be '----'
